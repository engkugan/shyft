            Routing concepts:

            routing point/object:
                act as *destination* for other sources, like cells, or other upstream routing objects
                have an optional state (if the implementation need it).
                have one optional output to downstream routing point|object
                                            and 'routing-shape' that determine the response at the output.

            cells have routing info, describing the
             routing destination identifier (a number, used to bind to a certain node the routing network)
             routing parameter(s) (how discharge are shaped before reaching the routing destination)

             implementation:

             -# routing-network [ { routing-node { id,opt output id + shape } ]
             -# region_model can be created with a routing-network
             -# cell.geo.routing { id, shape-parameters }
